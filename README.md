**Passli** is an enterprise-grade, privacy-first personal records vault and ephemeral cryptographic sharing platform. It enables individuals and organizations to share sensitive documents (e.g., medical records, identity credentials, diplomas, vehicle papers) with recipients via time-gated **Share Passes** without exposing master cloud credentials, unencrypted email attachments, or cascading folder permissions.

---

## 🔒 The Problem Passli Solves

When sharing sensitive records with doctors, employers, financial institutions, or rental agencies, users are traditionally forced to:
1. **Send raw email attachments** that persist indefinitely across mail relays and recipient drives.
2. **Share master cloud storage links** (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), risking account leakage and folder cascading.
3. **Hand over unlocked physical devices** to third parties.

**Passli replaces these vulnerabilities with time-gated, cryptographic Share Passes.** You select specific records, define an expiration window (15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 24h, or 1-time view), set download or view-only constraints, and present an isolated QR code and 8-character Share Key. When the session expires or is revoked by the owner, recipient access is mathematically severed.

## ✨ Core Platform Features

### 🗄️ 1. Personal Document Vault
- **Domain Taxonomy**: Organize records into structured categories (`Medical`, `Education`, `Vehicle`, `Personal & Identity`, `Professional`, `Other`).
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Automatic SHA-256 binary hash digests computed on ingestion for tamper validation.
- **In-Browser Secure Preview**: Stream decrypted PDF documents and high-resolution image records safely without local disk leakage.

### 🔑 2. Cryptographic Share Passes & Ephemeral QR Protocol
- **Zero-Knowledge Key Storage**: Plaintext 8-character Share Keys (`XXXX-XXXX`) are never saved to disk; only salted PBKDF2 hashes are stored.
- **Two-Factor Access Guard**: Decryption requires scanning the isolated session URL **plus** entering the valid Share Key.
- **Granular Permissions**: Restrict recipients to in-browser viewing only or grant file download permissions.
- **Server-Enforced Expirations**: Hardware session termination on timer expiry (15 min to 24 hrs) or burn-after-reading 1-time access.
- **Immediate 1-Click Revocation**: Instantly terminate any active pass and sever recipient sessions in real-time.

### 📱 3. Responsive Recipient Portal
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for smartphones scanning QR codes, with swipeable document selector chips and touch-friendly viewers.
- **Session Countdown Timer**: Real-time ticker notifying recipients of remaining access duration.
- **Memory Wipe on Exit**: Explicit session termination button clearing decrypted in-browser memory.

### 🛡️ 4. Security & Audit Threat Feed
- **Structured Audit Logging**: Immutable access trail recording IP addresses, user agents, verification successes, failed attempts, and brute-force lockouts.
- **Rate-Limiting & Lockouts**: Exponential backoff and lockouts protecting share passes against automated brute-force attempts.

### ⚡ 5. Custom Platform Administration Console
- **System Telemetry & Storage Analytics**: Real-time storage consumption (MB/GB), category breakdown bars, and active pass monitors at `/admin-dashboard/`.
- **User Governance**: Searchable user management directory with quota inspection, account activation toggles, and staff role promotions.
- **Global File Inventory**: Platform-wide vault explorer with SHA-256 hash inspection and physical disk file cleanup.
- **Emergency Pass Governance**: System-wide pass monitor with instant emergency revocation capabilities.

## 📊 Security Architecture Comparison

| Specification | Passli Share Pass | Cloud Shared Folders | Email Attachments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Encryption Standard** | Client-isolated AES-256 + PBKDF2 key hashing | Server-side at rest only | Unencrypted MIME transit |
| **Credential Exposure** | **Zero exposure** (Ephemeral session) | Exposes folder trees & account metadata | Permanent static copies on recipient host |
| **Session Expiration** | **Strict server & hardware timer** | Manual disabling; indefinite persistence | Impossible; persists forever in inboxes |
| **Granular Access** | **Itemized per-pass document bundling** | All-or-nothing folder cascades | Detached static payloads |
| **Audit Visibility** | **Real-time structured access logs & IP feed** | Basic access history (Enterprise only) | Zero visibility after send |
