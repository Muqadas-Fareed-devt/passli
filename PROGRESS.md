## 🎯 Phase Details & Deliverables


### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation, Anti-Slop Design System & Landing Page
- [x] Django 5 project initialized with modular app architecture (`accounts`, `documents`, `sharing`, `audit`, `config`).
- [x] Vanilla CSS Design System with custom properties (`static/css/styles.css`).
- [x] Human-crafted anti-AI-slop UI standards enforced (referencing `LeoStehlik/no-slop-ui` and `unslop-ui v2`).
- [x] Clean Split-Hero layout with authentic high-resolution security photography.
- [x] Interactive client-side Share Pass Generator simulator.
- [x] Real-world scenario showcase (Clinic visits, Job KYC verification, Vehicle registration).
- [x] Institutional Security Comparison Matrix (Passli vs Cloud Folders vs Email).
- [x] Responsive navigation bar with verified on-page anchor targets.
- [x] CodeRabbit review and rewrite protocol integrated into `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] 11 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase1.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 2: User Authentication & Personal Vault Dashboard
- [x] Custom `RegisterForm` with email uniqueness validation and input styling.
- [x] Custom `LoginForm` with credential sanitization and session handling.
- [x] `register_view` with automatic session login and welcome messaging.
- [x] `CustomLoginView` and `CustomLogoutView` with redirect targets.
- [x] Protected `@login_required` `dashboard_view` calculating live vault metrics.
- [x] Semantic HTML5 templates: `templates/accounts/login.html`, `register.html`, and `dashboard.html`.
- [x] Vault statistics grid, storage usage tracker, and empty-state placeholders.
- [x] 11 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase2.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Document Vault Management & Categorization
- [x] `Document` model with user-isolated storage paths (`vault_files/user_<id>/<uuid>.<ext>`).
- [x] Automatic SHA-256 cryptographic checksum calculation and MIME verification on save.
- [x] Domain taxonomy: Medical Records, Education & Degrees, Vehicle & Asset, Personal & Identity, Professional, Other.
- [x] `DocumentUploadForm` and `DocumentEditForm` with 25 MB size constraint and extension whitelisting.
- [x] Safe in-browser decrypted preview for PDF documents and high-resolution images.
- [x] Secure download streaming with sanitized `Content-Disposition` attachment headers.
- [x] Robust IDOR security guards on view, preview, download, edit, and delete operations.
- [x] Automatic physical disk sanitization on document deletion.
- [x] Real-time dashboard integration showing actual document counts, storage used (MB), and recent vault records.
- [x] 17 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase3.py`.

---

### ✅ Security & Vulnerability Defense Suite
- [x] **IDOR Attack Prevention**: Complete test verification that Bob cannot view, download, edit, or delete Alice's documents (HTTP 404 enforcement).
- [x] **Unauthenticated Access Redirection**: All protected routes (`/dashboard/`, `/documents/`, `/documents/upload/`, `/documents/<id>/`, `/documents/<id>/download/`, `/documents/<id>/edit/`, `/documents/<id>/delete/`) redirect to login.
- [x] **Malicious File Upload Defense**: Instant rejection of executable scripts (`.exe, .bat, .sh, .py, .php, .html, .js`).
- [x] **File Size Constraint Defense**: Client & form level enforcement rejecting payloads > 25 MB.
- [x] **Path Traversal Sanitization**: Multi-level path traversal payloads (`../../../../etc/shadow.pdf`) sanitized to isolated UUID filenames in user partition.
- [x] **Cryptographic Integrity Checksum**: SHA-256 binary validation on every saved file.
- [x] **Session Destruction Verification**: POST logout destroys session cookies and revokes protected route access.
- [x] 10 automated security tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_security.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Controlled Share Pass Generation & Ephemeral QR Protocol
- [x] `SharePass` model with many-to-many document relationships, UUID primary keys, and usage constraints.
- [x] Ephemeral Share Key generation (cryptographically secure 8-character token `XXXX-XXXX`) and PBKDF2 hashing.
- [x] Zero-knowledge key storage: Plaintext keys never stored on disk; verified via salted PBKDF2 hash.
- [x] Configurable time-to-live (15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 24h, 1-time view).
- [x] Granular permission toggles: In-browser View enforced, Download toggleable.
- [x] Dynamic high-contrast QR code generation via `qrcode` with base64 data URI and direct PNG attachment streaming.
- [x] Interactive UI templates: `templates/sharing/create.html`, `detail.html`, and `list.html`.
- [x] Immediate 1-click revocation mechanism from owner pass details and pass list.
- [x] Dashboard integration: Live active passes metrics and recent active passes bento panel.
- [x] 16 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase4.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Recipient Verification Portal & Two-Factor Access Flow
- [x] Public recipient route `/p/<uuid:pass_id>/` requiring Share Key submission.
- [x] Rate-limited key verification (5 attempts max before automatic lockout).
- [x] Isolated in-browser viewer for authorized documents without account leakage.
- [x] Server-enforced download gating (`can_download`).
- [x] Expired / Revoked pass error states with clean security diagnostics.
- [x] Session destruction on explicit departure (`/leave/`).
- [x] 14 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase5.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 6: Audit Trail, Immediate Revocation & Rate Limiting
- [x] Structured immutable audit logging (`ShareAccessLog`) tracking timestamp, IP, user-agent, key attempt, event type, and outcome.
- [x] Automated audit logging triggers across recipient key verification, preview streaming, downloads, session exits, and lockouts.
- [x] Owner Security Audit Dashboard (`/audit/`) with metric counters, multi-attribute filter toolbar, keyword search, and pagination.
- [x] Strict IDOR isolation ensuring users only see audit trails for passes they own.
- [x] 1-click immediate pass revocation from owner dashboard & pass details.
- [x] Rate limiting brute-force defense with structured lockout auditing.
- [x] 13 automated unit tests created and verified in `tests/unit/test_phase6.py`.

---

### ✅ Phase 7: End-to-End Testing, Production Hardening & Audit Report
- [x] Comprehensive End-to-End User & Recipient Lifecycle suite in `tests/selenium/test_e2e_user_journey.py`.
- [x] Full simulation covering owner registration, document upload, SHA-256 verification, pass generation with PBKDF2 ephemeral key, adversary brute-force lockout, recipient verification, PDF preview stream, raw download, voluntary session exit, and owner 1-click revocation.
- [x] Full-featured DOCX-ready Markdown Verification & Security Audit Report in `PHASE7_TEST_REPORT.md`.
- [x] Zero-knowledge architecture and responsive UI audit verified across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewpoints.
- [x] 93 automated tests created and passing with 100% success rate across all repository suites.
