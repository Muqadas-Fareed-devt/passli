## 📐 Engineering Standards & Guidelines

1. **Python & Django Standards**:
   - Adhere strictly to PEP 8 and idiomatic Django conventions.
   - Keep business logic in models or service layers, avoiding overly fat views.
   - Avoid N+1 queries by using `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`.

2. **Security & Data Protection**:
   - Never hardcode secrets, passwords, or encryption keys in source code.
   - All sensitive variables must be retrieved from environment variables (`.env`).
   - Validate and sanitize all user input; protect against IDOR by checking ownership in all views.
   - Plaintext cryptographic keys must **never** be persisted to the database.

3. **UI / UX Design Aesthetics**:
   - Follow the Passli human-crafted design system (`no-slop-ui` and `unslop-ui v2` standards).
   - Use clean, semantic HTML5 and Vanilla CSS tokens from `static/css/styles.css`.
   - Maintain full mobile responsiveness and avoid bloated CSS frameworks.

4. **Testing Discipline**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all new models, views, forms, and utilities.
   - Before submitting a pull request, verify that all test suites pass with 0 errors:
     ```bash
     python manage.py test
     ```
